Computer Assignment #1, Operating Systems Course, University of Tehran

This project is a client-server model implementation of a question and answer system for different disciplines (similar to stackoverflow) using socket programming and C system calls.
Clients ask their question using UDP sockets and communicate with the server with a TCP socket.

How to run the server:
```
./server 8888
```

How to connect a client:
```
./client 8888
```
